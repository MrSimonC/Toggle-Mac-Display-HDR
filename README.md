# Toggle Mac Display HDR

This AppleScript allows you to automate the toggling of using HDR of a display on MacOS. Useful when switching between watching HDR content (youtube, apple tv) to using regular applications.

Essentially it does the job one would have to do manually: Open System Preferences, go to Displays, click "High Dynamic Range".

Tested with: 
* MacOS Ventura (13.4.1(c)) August 2023

## Instructions for use

1. On your mac, open Script Editor
2. Copy / paste the contents of `Toggle Display HDR.scpt`
3. File Save / Hold option: File, Save As
4. Save the script as an application:
   1. Choose filename (e.g. "Toggle Display HDR")
   2. File format: Application
   3. Save to Applications Folder
5. Double click from the applications folder
6. Enable the script to be run by going into System Preferences, Security & Privacy, unlocking the dialogue box, then selecting (usually in Accessibility) `Toggle Display HDR` and whatever else it needs to run.

## Running

For me, the easiest method I've found is to use `cmd` + `space` to search for "Toggle Display HDR" and run it from there, or drag the application to the dock and click to trigger it.
